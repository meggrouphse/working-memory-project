!!! Important !!! 
In order to use the experimental paradigm on your folder, 
You need to upload all experimental files, 
Go to folder "pics" and put all files in the subfolders ("pics1", "pics2" and etc) into a "pics" folder. 
The psychopy will refer to the folder "pics" and will expect all stimulus files (grids) to be inside it, but not in the subfolders. 
Subfolders were used only for uploading purposes.
